- The default repo generated when prompts were enabled would include both the
  user/org name and the repo name, when it should just be the repo name.

- Added a shebang line to rt-to-github.pl

- The metacpan-github-names.pl will no longer be installed. This is only used
  for development.

- Added a --test option that you should use when testing a conversion. This
  sets --force and --no-resolve. It also changes how ticket bodies are
  formatted to avoid @mentioning people.

- Fixed links to attachments with spaces and other characters that needed URI
  escaping.

- Also include tickets with a status of "patched".

- Added a monkey patch to work around
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=118729, which caused some ticket
  or comment bodies to be lost entirely.

0.01     2016-11-06
